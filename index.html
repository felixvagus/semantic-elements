      <h1>Semantic Elements Assignment</h1>
      <p><b>Semantic elements</b> are codes for HTML that help to diversify text on a
        website, as well as make them do things. Many of these semantic elements
        can make a code go in different fonts, or add different ways of organizing
        your text. Another thing semantic elements can do is change the overall
        layout of the page you are working on, rather than just individual text.</p>
